Recreates the Exchange Rates page of the Revolut mobile application as single page React app with Redux

Uses Create-React-App to save time doing boilerplate

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

The extra rates page was added in error so I've left in the basic shell before I switched to the correct page
